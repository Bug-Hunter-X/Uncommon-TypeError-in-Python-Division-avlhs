This repository contains an example of an uncommon TypeError in Python that can occur during division. The file `bug.py` demonstrates the issue, where attempting to divide an integer by a string results in a TypeError. The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to prevent the error by explicitly converting the second input to an integer before division.  This demonstrates the importance of robust input validation and type checking when writing Python code.
